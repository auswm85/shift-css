Shift CSS is an open-source CSS framework built for the modern web. It solves four critical problems with existing frameworks:

## The Problems

### 1. Color Inconsistency

RGB-based frameworks produce "muddy" color scales. Blue-500 and Yellow-500 might have the same numeric value, but vastly different perceived brightness. Shift CSS uses **OKLCH** - a perceptually uniform color space where every shade at the same level looks equally bright.

### 2. The "Dark Mode Tax"

Traditional frameworks require redundant classes like `bg-white dark:bg-black` for every themed element. Shift CSS uses the native CSS `light-dark()` function - components automatically adapt to `prefers-color-scheme` with zero additional classes.

### 3. Specificity Wars

Overriding framework styles often requires `!important` or convoluted selectors. Shift CSS uses **CSS Cascade Layers** - all framework styles live in `@layer shift.*`, so any user-defined CSS naturally takes precedence.

### 4. Static Breakpoints

Media queries respond to the viewport, but modern components need to respond to their container. Shift CSS prioritizes **Container Queries** for truly modular, reusable components.

## Core Principles

- **Zero Runtime**: No JavaScript required for theming or color calculations
- **Build Optional**: Ship a single CSS file, customize entirely via CSS variables
- **Perceptually Correct**: OKLCH ensures consistent visual appearance across hues
- **Future-Facing**: Targets cutting-edge browsers (Chrome 131+, Firefox 133+, Safari 18+)
